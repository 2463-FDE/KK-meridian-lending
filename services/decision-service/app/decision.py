"""Credit decisioning.

This logic was lifted verbatim out of the origination service into its own
decision-service — the behaviour (and the debt) is unchanged by the split.

The credit pull, the bureau call, and the model run are a SYNCHRONOUS chain executed
inline on the request thread (load note: timeouts past ~20 concurrent apps).

Adverse-action reasons are a generic nearest-checkbox string ("purchasing history") that
does NOT reflect the model's actual top features. No decision record is persisted beyond
the bare outcome in the `decisions` table — no inputs, no model drivers, no reason, no
timestamp. There is no append-only audit trail. (D4, D9, D10)
