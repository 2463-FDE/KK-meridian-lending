"""APR money-math tests.

These used to FAIL by design (float money math + a drifted fee constant breaching
the Reg Z APR tolerance -- D12 and D6). Both are fixed now: apr.py/offer.py/
schedule.py compute in Decimal throughout, and ORIGINATION_FEE_PCT has one
source of truth (fees.py) instead of three independent copies. These tests
should pass -- if either regresses, one of these two fixes broke.
